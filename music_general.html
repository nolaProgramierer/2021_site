                        A veteran of touring Broadway shows, Langdon was Music Director of the touring production of Andrew Lloyd Weber's the Phantom of the Opera. On tour, Glenn traveled to over 60 cities in the United States and Canada over 14 years, conducting close to 5000 performances of the world's most successful Broadway musical productions.

                        With his wide musical curiosity and a strong interest in story telling, Langdon was inevitably drawn to work in the field of dance as well. As Music Director and principal conductor of the Houston Ballet he conducted the breadth of the classical repertory and distinguished himself with performances of the 20th century works by Stravinsky, Orff, and Prokofiev. Collaborating with jazz legend Cleo Laine and her husband John Dankworth, Langdon led the premiere of a dance theater piece, Lady In Waiting, in Houston, Texas and conducted the world premier of the ballet Gautama Buddha by British composer Naresh Sohal at the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.

                    <p>The programmer has taken a video of a portion of a piano recital he gave in New York City.
                        The video is hosted on AWS and is played on an instance of JWPlayer. According to the viewers
                        perferences, the video can be viewed by itself or with the music shown.</p>
                    <p>If the viewer wishes to view the music as the video plays, checkboxes allow the viewer to
                        choose the extent to which the music played on the video is shown. The music can be followed
                        in brief slides and with an overlay highlighting the portion of the slide being played can be shown.
                        The speed with which the overlay traverses the slides is determined by the duration of the music
                        which
                        was determined to the 6th decimal point by a custom function used to capture each slide's duration
                        with respect to the music being played. The pages of the larger music score change according to
                        the video. A measure counter for the music being displayed is also available by checkbox.</p>
